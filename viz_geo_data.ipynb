    "From scientific fields like meteorology and climatology, through to the software on our smartphones like Google Maps and Facebook check-ins, geographic data is always present in our everyday lives. Raw geographic data like latitudes and longitudes are difficult to understand using the data charts and plots we've discussed so far. To explore this kind of data, you'll need to learn how to visualize the data on maps.\n",

Two-dimensional maps are faster to render, easier to view on a computer and distribute, and are more familiar to the experience of popular mapping software like Google Maps. Latitude and longitude values describe points on a sphere, which is three-dimensional. To plot the values on a two-dimensional plane, we need to convert the coordinates to the Cartesian coordinate system using a map projection.\n",

Each map projection makes trade-offs in what properties to preserve and you can read about the different trade-offs here. We'll use the Mercator projection, because it is commonly used by popular mapping software."

We can pass in a list of latitude and longitude values into the basemap instance and it will return back converted lists of longitude and latitude values using the projection we specified earlier. The constructor only accepts list values, so we'll need to use Series.tolist() to convert the longitude and latitude columns from the airports dataframe to lists. "
